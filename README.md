Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains applied data science projects demonstrating my skills in Python, machine learning, and model evaluation. Projects focus on classification and regression problems, model comparison, cross-validation, and interpretability.

## 1. Corporate Finance Profit Classification

Objective: Classify companies as High, Medium, or Low Profit
Models: Random Forest
Best Result: ~75% accuracy
Key Insight: Revenue and total assets dominated predictive power, accounting for ~65% of feature importance, highlighting firm scale as a primary driver of profitability classification.

## 2. Fortune 500 Profitability Classification

Objective: Predict whether companies are Above or Below Average Profit
Models: Logistic Regression
Best Result: ~82% accuracy (cross-validated ~79%)
Key Insight: Logistic Regression generalized well, with cross-validation confirming minimal overfitting and stable performance.


## 3. Adult Income Classification

Objective: Predict whether income exceeds $50K
Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Best Result: ~85–86% accuracy
Key Insight: Relationship status, capital gains, and education were the strongest predictors, aligning with known socioeconomic patterns.

## 4. Real Estate Price Prediction

Objective: Predict housing prices
Models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Bagging
Best Result: Random Forest (best RMSE and R²)
Key Insight: Ensemble tree models consistently outperformed linear models, with Random Forest providing the strongest balance between accuracy and generalization.
