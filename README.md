This repository showcases my data science projects, demonstrating my skills in Python and machine learning. 

## Projects

### 1.  Clustering Fortune 500 Companies
- **Objective**: Grouped Fortune 500 companies based on revenue using k-means clustering.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, KMeans
- **Highlights**:
  - Clustered companies into four segments based on profitability.
  - Created a csv file to show the companies broken down into their respective segments.

### 2. Corporate Finance Data Project
- **Objective**: Developed a Random Forest model to classify companies as High, Medium, or Low Profit.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Random Forest, Scikit-Learn.
- **Highlights**:
  - Achieved 75% model accuracy.
  - Analyzed feature importance and found that of the four input features that were used, total revenue, total assets, capital expenditures, and current ratio, the first two combined contributed to approximately 65% of the model.

### 3. Fortune 500 Classification ML 
- **Objective**: Developed a Logistic Regression model to classify Fortune 500 companies as "Above Average Profit" or "Below Average Profit"
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Logistic Regression, Scikit-Learn.
- **Highlights**:
  - Achieved 82% model accuracy.
  - Did cross-validation and got an accuracy percentage that was very similar (approx. 79%). 


### 4. Company Data Regression ML
- **Objective**: Developed a Linear Regression model to predict the corporate net income based on input features such as total revenue, total assets, and long term investments. Did the same thing but wiht a Decision Tree Regression model to compare the results with those of the former. 
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor
- **Highlights**:
  - Achieved an r2 score of approximately 0.84 using the Linear Regression model.
  - Found that the Linear Regression model is a better fit than the Deicison Tree Regression model due to its significantly lower mean squared error.
