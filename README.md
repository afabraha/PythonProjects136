This repository showcases my data science projects, demonstrating my skills in Python and machine learning. 

## Projects

### 1.  Clustering Fortune 500 Companies
- **Objective**: Group Fortune 500 companies based on revenue using k-means clustering.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, KMeans
- **Highlights**:
  - Clustered companies into four segments based on profitability.
  - Created a csv file to show the companies broken down into their respective segments.

### 2. Corporate Finance Data Project
- **Objective**: Developed a Random Forest model to classify companies as High, Medium, or Low Profit.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Random Forest, Scikit-Learn.
- **Highlights**:
  - Achieved 75% model accuracy.
  - Analyzed feature importance and found that of the four input features that were used, total revenue, total assets, capital expenditures, and current ratio, the first two combined contributed to approximately 65% of the model. 

### 3. Fortune 500 ML Analysis
- **Objective**: Developed both a Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression model to classify Fortune 500 companies as "Above Average Revenue" or "Below Average Revenue" using input features such as profits, assets, and number of employees. 
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Matplotlib
- **Highlights**:
  - Achieved 81% accuracy using Support Vector Machine model and 80% accuracy using Logistic Regression
  - Displayed a horizontal barchart showing the importance of each of the features to the models.

### 4. National HMDA Project
- **Objective**: Used a Logistic Regression model to predict whether particular combinations of features such as race, sex, applicant income, property type, and loan purpose would result in either a loan approval or denial.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Logistic Regression, Scikit-Learn
- **Highlights**:
  - Achieved 62% model accuracy.
